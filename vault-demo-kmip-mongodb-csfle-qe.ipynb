    "# HashiCorp Vault Demo for KMIP Secrets Engine and MongoDB Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) & Queryable Encryption (QE)\n",
    "\n",
    "With MongoDB’s Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) and Queryable Encryption (QE), applications can encrypt sensitive plain text fields in documents prior to transmitting data to the server. This means that data processed by database (in use) will not be in plain text as it’s always encrypted and most importantly still can be queried (QE). \n",
    "\n",
    "This demo showcases how MongoDB CSFLE and QE uses HashiCorp Vault's KMIP Secrets Engine to manage encryption keys via KMIP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: MongoDB Community & Enterprise server editions have the same developer features (queries, aggregation, replication, sharding, etc).  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced adds:\n",
    "- Operational & security features (In-memory storage engine, Auditing, Kerberos & LDAP authentication, Encryption at Rest). https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/upgrade-community-to-enterprise/\n",
    "- Entitlements to use additional tools including Ops Manager, BI Connector, and Enterprise Operator for Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSFLE is offered on both Community and Enterprise Edition. The only difference is that Enterprise edition can perform automatic encryption based on JSONSchema (which is also used by the mongocryptd library). For the community edition the application will be responsible for performing this encryption. \n",

    "## Setup of the Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is tested on MacOS and is meant to simulate a distributed setup.  The components used in this demo are:\n",
    "- Vault Enterprise installed on docker (to simulate an external Vault)\n",
    "- MongoDB Enterprise installed on docker (to simulate an external MongoDB)\n",
    "- You have the Vault CLI installed\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes your Vault server is installed using docker and already running on http://127.0.0.1:8200\n",
    "and you have set your VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You will need Vault to be installed with an ADP KMIP license add-on.  Also note that a Premium license is required if you wish the KMIP listener to scale on the Vault cluster.  For Standard or Plus license, the KMIP listener is only on the leader node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements to Run This Demo\n",
    "You will need Visual Studio Code to be installed with the Jupyter plugin.  To run this notebook in VS Code, chose the Jupyter kernel and then Bash.\n",
    "- To run the current cell, use Ctrl + Enter.\n",
    "- To run the current cell and advance to the next, use Shift+Enter."
